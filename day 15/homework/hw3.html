        <p>
            <b>Men's Singles </b> - Jumps, spins, and step sequences performed by male skaters. <br>
            <b>Women's Singles</b> - Similar to men's but with differences in typical jump combinations.<br>
            <b>Pairs Skating </b>- A male and female skater perform together, featuring throws, lifts, and synchronized jumps.<br>
            <b>Ice Dance </b>- Focuses on rhythm, footwork, and dance holds (no jumps or throws; lifts are different from pairs).<br>
            <b>Synchronized Skating</b> - Teams of 8-16 skaters perform together in unison.
        </p>

                The Axel
            </b>
