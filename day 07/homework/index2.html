<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
<h3>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. <br>It works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance web functionality, enabling animations, user interactions, and real-time updates.</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
 <b>Client-side execution:</b> Runs directly in the browser without needing a server. <br>
 <b>Event-driven:</b>  Responds to user actions like clicks, scrolling, and keyboard inputs.<br>
 <b>Lightweight and flexible:</b> Works well with HTML and CSS to modify web pages dynamically.<br>
 <b>Object-oriented:</b> Uses objects and prototypes for organizing and structuring code. <br>
 <b>Cross-platform compatibility:</b> Runs on all major browsers and operating systems. <br>
 <b>Asynchronous programming:</b>Allows tasks like data fetching without blocking the main execution thread.  <br>
<hr>
<h2>JavaScript Variables and Data Types</h2>
 <h3>var (older), let (modern, block-scoped), and const (unchangeable values).<br> The language includes various data types:</h3> 
 <b>Primitive types:</b>Strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null, and symbols. <br>
 <b>Objects:</b>  Collections of key-value pairs used to store complex data.<br>
 <b>Arrays:</b>  Ordered lists of values.<br>
<hr>
<h2>Functions in JavaScript</h2>
 <h3>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.<br> They can accept inputs (parameters) and return outputs. <br>Functions can be declared traditionally or using arrow functions for a more concise syntax</h3> 
<hr>
<h2>JavaScript Events</h2>
 <h3>JavaScript interacts with user actions through events. Events include clicks, keypresses, mouse movements, and form submissions. These events trigger specific code execution to enhance interactivity.</h3>
<hr>
<h2>JavaScript in Web Development</h2>
 <h3>JavaScript is essential for creating dynamic and interactive websites. Common uses include:</h3> 
 <p><b>Form validation:</b> Ensuring correct user input before submission. <br>
 <b>Dynamic content updates:</b>  Changing text, images, and elements without reloading the page. <br>
 <b>Animations and effects:</b> Creating visual enhancements for user engagement. <br>
 <b>API interactions:</b> Fetching and displaying data from external sources. </p> <br>
